# HuffmanCoding-DataCompression

This program converts data into a compressed form using Huffman algorithm. This compression reduces the size of the data and helps in reducing the storage and transmission cost. This program creates a Huffamn tree and assigns code values to each characte, thereby reducing the bits consumed by each character.
